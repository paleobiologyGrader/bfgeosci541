##Summary
Many studies of the fossil record have revolved around the mechanistic processes underlying extinction, and it has been shown that the causes of extinction are often context specific. Determining causality or overall trends, however, has been extremely difficult. And most have looked only at particular mass extinction events. Here, Payne and Finnegan look at geographic range and its effect on survivorship regimes between mass and background extinctions. In order to test this proposed relationship, the researchers did a few different things. The first methodology employed was the creation of log-odds for genus survivorship to geographic range within each of the 47 intervals under study. Using single regression, 44 showed a significant relationship between the two. By utilizing multiple regression to mitigate the effects of both species richness and the number of global occurrences, they found that neither has as great of an impact on extinction risk as geographic range. In order to control for sampling heterogeneity, Payne and Finnegan compared odds ratios to five variables. These were the number of occurrences, number of tectonic plates, global sea level, number of named formations, and the proportion of "range through" genera. Range through meaning those genera sampled in directly adjacent intervals, but not in the interval itself.

logistic regression because binary, not continuous --> odds ratio (log-odds; odds of an outcome and its explanatory variable) --> 0 = absence of association; greater than or less than zero = positive/inverse associations between outcome and explanatory variable.
  - Odds ratio = p/(1-p):geographic range...what is the measure of geographic range? number of named geological formations in which the genus occurred?

geographic range positively correlated with survivorship throughout fossil record (significantly in 44 of 47 examined intervals)

multiple logistic regression in order to determine effect of geographic range on survivorship, independent of species richness and number of occurrences worldwide
  - found that geographic range selectivity in data is more consistent with extinction data than either of the other two
  - suggests the association of richness/number of occurrences w/ extinction risk in single regressions partially reflect a          geographic range correlation

Because the researchers investigated different extinction risks amongst varying range sizes *within* 10 Myr intervals, instead of *between* them, sampling heterogeneities play less of a role.
  - Genera in well sampled intervals tend to have larger absolute ranges than less well sampled intervals
  - Did look into how it affected geographic range selectivity by comparing odds ratios to five different variables in the fossil record
    - total number of occurrences
    - total number of tectonic plates
    - contemporaneous global sea level
    - proportion of "range through" genera (before and after an interval, but not in it; not considered in the initial analysis)

only the number of tectonic plates was both significant at the traditional alpha value of 0.05 as well as explaining more than ten percent of the log-odds variation
  - Reflects intense sampling in mass extinction intervals (late Triassic and end Cretaceous)
    - each reflects both low selectivity and a low number of sampled plates, despite intensive sampling of these intervals
    - excluding the intervals previous to and after the end Cretaceous, as well as the end Cretaceous itself, explanation of variance decreases to 6%
    - should show an inverse relationship between sampled plates and geographic range selectivity, because narrow range distributions should display last occurrences when sampling quality decreases into the subsequent interval
