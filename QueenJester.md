#The Red Queen and the Court Jester: Species Diversity and the Role of Biotic and Abiotic Factors Through Time
###Michael J. Benton (2009)

##Summary
Evolution, depending on who you talk to, can be viewed either through the lense of the Court Jester hypothesis or the Red Queen hypothesis. The Red Queen diversification hypothesis emphasizes the role of competition, predation, and biotic factors; intrinsic characteristics. On the other hand, the Court Jester model focuses on the role of extrinsic conditions such as climate and tectonics when looking at evolution and diversity. Furthermore, biotic pressures act on species diversity across relatively short timescales (up to 100,000 years) and external factors play a more important role across larger scales. Two different types of models have been used to show these two different concepts. The first set - saturation/equilibrium models - differ in the timing of saturation of the marine biome as well as the amount of equilibria throughout the ages. These model a typical Red Queen scenario, in which competition is the main driver behind evolution and diversity change.
